    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object oriented programming** (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class\n",
    "A **class** is a blueprint for how something should be defined. It doesn’t actually contain any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object\n",
    "An **object** is the instance of a class. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `isinstance(object, classinfo)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `isinstance()` function returns `True` if the *object* argument is an instance of the *classinfo* argument."
